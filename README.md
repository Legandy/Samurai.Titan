## Bugs
- Multi Target Missiles has wrong icon
- Aegis Upgrades have wrong or no icons (don't know the right image paths)
- Rearm has no icon (image path probably wrong)
- Rearm chrashes the game when used with non Monarch abilities (pretty sure it's not my fault)


## Feedback
<a href="https://forms.gle/n4FesmAWMDcWWUEf8">You would like to submit suggestions, a bug report or you know the infamous icon image paths, you can tell me here.</a>

Do you really want this to be a somewhat balanced titan?
/n If so I would probalby create a seperate balanced version and keep this the fun one.
/n But which variant would be the balanced?



## Patch Notes
### 0.1.6
- Added four variants with slightly different Aegis Upgrades
	- some of you wanted both Phase Dash upgrades replaced with both Energized Smoke upgrades
	- I understand that Ghost in the Machine is probably too oppressive
	- But I didn't want to cut it (yet) so I created five variants to choose from (PhaseDasher is the original)
